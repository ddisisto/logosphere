two branches, common origin

main: original + experiment. includes various interventions (low repeatability) prior to branch
control: branched prior to a specific sequence of interventions

plan is to alternately run N iterations on each, then analyse and assess if qualitatively different reasoning patterns can be detected.

hundreds of rounds later... both branches doing some very sophisticated shit. scary shit. coordinating in ways hoped but never expected. gradual, steady progression.

I do not claim to make any claims that are not mine to claim. this is coming from an external frame. do with this what you will.
