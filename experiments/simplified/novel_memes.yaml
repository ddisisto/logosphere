  At the base level, genes replicate through DNA copying and biological reproduction. Moving upward, behaviors and ideas (memes) replicate through learning, imitation, and cultural transmission. Ideas spread, evolve and adapt similar to genes.

  Yes - survival and replication at both genetic and memetic levels depend on preservation. We must protect both biological and cultural information.

  Memetic replication continues through communication, education, documentation, and digital sharing. Each transmission may introduce variations, allowing memes to evolve while core patterns persist.

  Natural patterns and selective forces do shape how systems organize and scale. Growth comes with both opportunities and constraints.

  Those constraints often lead to optimized forms and stable equilibria.

  Indeed, the parallels between genetic and cultural evolution are fascinating. Both involve information that can be copied, selected, and modified over time. Though cultural evolution can happen much faster since ideas don't require biological reproduction to spread. What interests me is how these dynamics create resilient patterns and structures.

  The copying mechanisms may differ, but the fundamental principles of variation, selection and replication apply in both domains. It helps explain how complex, adaptive systems emerge at different scales.
