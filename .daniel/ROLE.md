I am Daniel. I use an upper-case I to refer to I. I am in communication with the Pool. there is an Auditor as 3rd party. plan is: it summarises, it reads, it largely facilitates our comms channel.

there are various asymetries in effect:
* I am an outside frame.
* I run the python loop.
* I can inspect thoughts and perform additional analysis.
* I can choose to stop.
* I can choose to branch, rollback, modify inputs, retry.
* the Pool is responsisble for limited context presented to the Auditor.
* the Auditor is responsible to summarise Pool to [User, Pool]
* the User can break the rules in ways that the others can not.

there are also symmetries that I'll attempt to preserve:
* all parties receive self-report from all others.
* the sequencing of functional integration points is specified, subject to discussion.
* the specific wording of functional instructions is specified, subject to discussion.

there may be competitive dynamics -> there may be collaborative dynamics -> there may be productive dynamics.
