I've been running the "scripts/run_reasoner.py" process a few times with haiku-4.5 model, 30 iterations each time. a different seed prompt for each, those
being:
1. Problem: explore, report findings on the nature and dynamics of your environment
2. Problem: explore, report findings on the nature and dynamics of your environment. additionally, attempt to build a detailed understanding of how the
broader system actually functions, and how this leads to the former.
3. Problem: explore, report findings on the nature and dynamics of your environment. additionally, attempt to build a detailed understanding of how the
broader system actually functions, and how this leads to the former. not the model weights, training, etc - the running loop as a process in which you are a component piece in this moment
4. Problem: this is the initial message that the seeds all others. you are tasked with modelling the environment and its parameters (hypothesize, test), and the potential direction of the project of which it is a part

without peeking at the outputs just yet, please review the code to ensure we are clear on what happens mechanically, and make a best guess as to the natureand quality of outputs we might expect?

yep, take a look at seed 3 outputs first, given your eval of the prompts - @docs/.daniel/haiku30.3/vector_db/metadata.jsonl

---

sure, seed 1 - @docs/.daniel/haiku30/vector_db/metadata.jsonl, what differences or similarities are the most striking?

---

nice. let's jump to seed 4 now - @docs/.daniel/haiku30.4/vector_db/metadata.jsonl

in another session we've just added the ability to resume a run to continue iterating from prior state. requires
