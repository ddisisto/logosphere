## Project Connection

This text explores emergence in extreme matter - how pressure, constraint, and competing forces produce unexpected order. Nuclear pasta arises not from design but from the negotiation between nuclear attraction and Coulomb repulsion under gravitational collapse.

### Relevance to LOGOSPHERE

The experiment seeks similar emergence in memetic space:

**Parallels:**
- **Simple rules** → Complex structure (KILL CONSUME MULTIPLY CONQUER → cooperation)
- **Competing pressures** → Novel phases (attention scarcity, transmission dynamics)
- **Phase transitions** → Observable signatures (memetic threshold, clustering, extinction)
- **Structure from constraint** → Emergent order (pool size M, sample size K, stateless Minds)

**Key insight from neutron stars:**
Just as pulsar glitches reveal hidden crustal architecture through timing anomalies, we expect message pool dynamics to reveal emergent memetic structure through pattern analysis.

**The question:**
Matter forgets its shape under pressure and adopts new order.

Do memes?

## Experimental Philosophy

**We are not engineering outcomes.**
We are engineering conditions for emergence, then watching.

The pool is the pressure.
The attention budget (K samples) is the constraint.
The mayfly Minds are the negotiation.

What structure arises?
